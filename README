= Requirements =

The application uses CherryPy as minimalistic web framework, Mako as a templating engine and SQLAlchemy as its ORM.

= Scraper =

The scraper is located at and can be run through: bof/politiekeagenda/scrapers/main.py.

If bypass_cache in config.py is set to True (default) the scraper will bypass the cache in bof/politiekeagenda/data/

= Database =

The application currently uses a SQLite database, which means that the user running the Apache process needs to have rw(x) permission on the database and all directories (to be able to lock it).

If you switch to a database server such as MySQL or PostgreSQL you won't have to.

The SQLite database is located at bof/politiekeagenda/database.sqlite

There are three tables: assemblies, revisions and config.

= Hosting =

You can use the following Apache configuration to host the application using mod_wsgi as http://politiekeagenda.bof.nl/:

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName politiekeagenda.bof.nl
        WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/politiekeagenda.bof.nl/bof/politiekeagenda/application.py
</VirtualHost>

= Debugging =

You can also run the application without hosting it by running bof/politiekeagenda/main.py

You can then access the application through http://localhost:8080/
